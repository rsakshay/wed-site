        The <em>upanayanam</em> marks the sacred initiation of the groom. 
        During this ceremony he receives the sacred thread (<em>yajnopavita</em>) and is symbolically admitted into Vedic learning and ritual life. 
        It signifies purity, discipline, and readiness to take on spiritual and household responsibilities.
