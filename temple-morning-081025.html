        The <em>upanayanam</em> marks the sacred initiation of the groom. 
        During this ceremony he receives the sacred thread (<em>yajnopavita</em>) and is symbolically admitted into Vedic learning and ritual life. 
        It signifies purity, discipline, and readiness to take on spiritual and household responsibilities.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>08:30 — Upanayanam begins in Small Yagashala</strong>: Groom is sat by the holy fire and rituals begin. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>09:30 — Kumara Bhojanam</strong>: Mother and sisters of the groom along with the groom and <em>Brahmachari's (Upanayanam done but not yet married)</em> in the groom’s family are served a special and auspicious meal. 
          This act symbolizes prosperity, the blessing of future generations, and continuity of lineage in the family.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>11:14 — Muhurtham</strong>: Auspicious time for the Upanayanam where the groom wears a sacred thread across his body and symbolic rituals like ear piercing and hair cutting etc. are performed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Snatakam</strong>: This is a “graduation” rite 
          where the groom symbolically completes his student life and prepares to enter the stage of a householder. 
          It signifies the groom’s readiness to take on responsibilities of family and society. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kashi Yatra</strong>: The groom pretends to renounce all worldly pleasures and sets off on a mock pilgrimage to Kashi to become an ascetic.
          Carrying a walking stick, an umbrella, and other items, he starts walking away. The bride's brother then intercepts him and convinces him to return and accept married life.
          The rituals conclude with <strong>Lunch at 1:00 pm</strong>.
